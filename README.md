# discord-bot-py-V2

A Discord bot app made in Python for fun

## Discord Bot + E-Commerce Application

This bot serves as a support tool for Discord servers with multiple features.

Using the command `!help`, the bot will show all available commands to try and use.

### Commands:

- ðŸ’¬`!ticket`ðŸ“‹
  - This command sends an embed UI to a chat (if there isn't one already) allowing users to select the type of ticket they want.
  > **Options**: 
        **Support**, **Financial**, **Bugs**, **Others**
  - **For each option**:
    1. The bot will create a channel that only the user and MODs can see and send messages.
    2. The bot will DM the user to remind them of the channel and provide a link to the ticket channel.
    3. The bot will send a message into the ticket channel.

- ðŸ’¬`!match`ðŸ•¹
  - This command allows users to set up a match before gameplay/service.
  > **Steps**:
    1. The bot will ask what game they are going to play/do.
    2. The bot will ask for the number of players for the match.
    3. The bot sends an embed UI and adds a reaction (âœ…) so users can react to join the match.
  - **Status**:
    - When all users react, the status of the embed will show: **Complete** with all the spots filled.
    - If the number of spots are not filled by gamers, the status will show: **Ended** and it will start the match with the users that reacted.

- ðŸ’¬`!poll`ðŸ“Š
  - This command creates a poll so users can decide what task to do and setup a poll to decide with emoji numbers on the discord.Ui.
  - Based on the numbers of the tasks/games, the bot will add the numbers of reaction based on that.
  > **Steps**:
    1. Use `!poll` in any chat and type the task/game you want
    2. Wait for the bot to send the UI and add your reaction to compute your vote
    3. The *poll* will be open for **30 seconds** and then will show the game chosen for everyone

- ðŸ’¬`!clear` + `int` ðŸ§¹

  > **Steps**:
